              <li>"Model training is only a small piece of the machine learning process."<sup>1</sup></li>
              <li>"...creating successful machine learning systems involves a lot more than choosing between a random forest model and a support vector machine model."<sup>1</sup></li>
              <li>"From choosing the proper ingestion mechanism to data cleansing to feature engineering, the initial steps in a machine learning pipeline are just as important as model selection. Also being able to properly measure and monitor the performance of your model in production and deciding when and how to retrain your models can be the difference between great results and mediocre outcomes. As the world changes, your input variables change, and your model must change with them."<sup>1</sup></li>
              <li>"One important item to consider is that each step in the pipeline produces an output that becomes the input for the next step in the pipeline. The term pipeline is somewhat misleading as it implies a one-way flow of data. In reality, machine learning pipelines can be cyclical and iterative. Every step in the pipeline might be repeated to achieve better results or cleaner data. Finally, the output variable might be used as input the next time the pipeline cycle is performed."<sup>1</sup></li>
